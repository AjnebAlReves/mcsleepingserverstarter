#### Use WebServer for dynmap :
- You need to change your configuration from class: `org.dynmap.InternalClientUpdateComponent` to class `org.dynmap.JsonFileClientUpdateComponent` *(comment all the section InternalClientUpdateComponent and uncomment JsonFileClientUpdateComponent)*
- Chat will not work when hosted by mcsleepingserverstarter. For a full compatibilty, you can use an apache server *(https://github.com/webbukkit/dynmap/wiki/Setting-up-without-the-Internal-Web-Server)*
